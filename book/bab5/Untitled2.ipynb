    "This is a book about Natural Language Processing. By “natural language” we mean a\n",
    "language that is used for everyday communication by humans; languages such as Eng-\n",
    "lish, Hindi, or Portuguese. In contrast to artificial languages such as programming lan-\n",
    "guages and mathematical notations, natural languages have evolved as they pass from\n",
    "generation to generation, and are hard to pin down with explicit rules. We will take\n",
    "Natural Language Processing—or NLP for short—in a wide sense to cover any kind of\n",
    "computer manipulation of natural language. At one extreme, it could be as simple as\n",
    "counting word frequencies to compare different writing styles. At the other extreme,\n",
    "NLP involves “understanding” complete human utterances, at least to the extent of\n",
    "being able to give useful responses to them.\n",
    "Technologies based on NLP are becoming increasingly widespread. For example,\n",
    "phones and handheld computers support predictive text and handwriting recognition;\n",
    "web search engines give access to information locked up in unstructured text; machine\n",
    "translation allows us to retrieve texts written in Chinese and read them in Spanish. By\n",
    "providing more natural human-machine interfaces, and more sophisticated access to\n",
    "stored information, language processing has come to play a central role in the multi-\n",
    "lingual information society.\n",
    "This book provides a highly accessible introduction to the field of NLP. It can be used\n",
    "for individual study or as the textbook for a course on natural language processing or\n",
    "computational linguistics, or as a supplement to courses in artificial intelligence, text\n",
    "mining, or corpus linguistics. The book is intensely practical, containing hundreds of\n",
    "fully worked examples and graded exercises.\n",
    "The book is based on the Python programming language together with an open source\n",
    "library called the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). NLTK includes extensive soft-\n",
    "ware, data, and documentation, all freely downloadable from http://www.nltk.org/.\n",
    "Distributions are provided for Windows, Macintosh, and Unix platforms. We strongly\n",
    "encourage you to download Python and NLTK, and try out the examples and exercises\n",
    "along the way.\n",
    "ixAudience\n",
    "NLP is important for scientific, economic, social, and cultural reasons. NLP is experi-\n",
    "encing rapid growth as its theories and methods are deployed in a variety of new lan-\n",
    "guage technologies. For this reason it is important for a wide range of people to have a\n",
    "working knowledge of NLP. Within industry, this includes people in human-computer\n",
    "interaction, business information analysis, and web software development. Within\n",
    "academia, it includes people in areas from humanities computing and corpus linguistics\n",
    "through to computer science and artificial intelligence. (To many people in academia,\n",
    "NLP is known by the name of “Computational Linguistics.”)\n",

    "tions of meaning (Chapters 8–10). The final chapter is devoted to linguistic data and\n",
    "how it can be managed effectively (Chapter 11). The book concludes with an After-\n",
    "word, briefly discussing the past and future of the field.\n",
    "Within each chapter, we switch between different styles of presentation. In one style,\n",
    "natural language is the driver. We analyze language, explore linguistic concepts, and\n",
    "use programming examples to support the discussion. We often employ Python con-\n",
    "structs that have not been introduced systematically, so you can see their purpose before\n",
    "delving into the details of how and why they work. This is just like learning idiomatic\n",
    "expressions in a foreign language: you’re able to buy a nice pastry without first having\n",
    "learned the intricacies of question formation. In the other style of presentation, the\n",
    "programming language will be the driver. We’ll analyze programs, explore algorithms,\n",
    "and the linguistic examples will play a supporting role.\n",
    "Each chapter ends with a series of graded exercises, which are useful for consolidating\n",
    "the material. The exercises are graded according to the following scheme: ○ is for easy\n",
    "exercises that involve minor modifications to supplied code samples or other simple\n",
    "activities; ◑ is for intermediate exercises that explore an aspect of the material in more\n",
    "depth, requiring careful analysis and design; ● is for difficult, open-ended tasks that\n",
    "will challenge your understanding of the material and force you to think independently\n",
    "(readers new to programming should skip these).\n",
    "Each chapter has a further reading section and an online “extras” section at http://www\n",
    ".nltk.org/, with pointers to more advanced materials and online resources. Online ver-\n",
    "sions of all the code examples are also available there.\n",
    "Why Python?\n",
    "Python is a simple yet powerful programming language with excellent functionality for\n",
    "processing linguistic data. Python can be downloaded for free from http://www.python\n",
    ".org/. Installers are available for all platforms.\n",
    "Here is a five-line Python program that processes file.txt and prints all the words ending\n",
    "in ing :\n",
    ">>> for line in open(\"file.txt\"):\n",
    "...\n",
    "for word in line.split():\n",
    "...\n",
    "if word.endswith('ing'):\n",
    "...\n",
    "print word\n",
    "This program illustrates some of the main features of Python. First, whitespace is used\n",
    "to nest lines of code; thus the line starting with if falls inside the scope of the previous\n",
    "line starting with for ; this ensures that the ing test is performed for each word. Second,\n",
    "Python is object-oriented; each variable is an entity that has certain defined attributes\n",
    "and methods. For example, the value of the variable line is more than a sequence of\n",
    "characters. It is a string object that has a “method” (or operation) called split() that\n",
    "xii | Prefacewe can use to break a line into its words. To apply a method to an object, we write the\n",
    "object name, followed by a period, followed by the method name, i.e., line.split() .\n",
    "Third, methods have arguments expressed inside parentheses. For instance, in the ex-\n",
    "ample, word.endswith('ing') had the argument 'ing' to indicate that we wanted words\n",
    "ending with ing and not something else. Finally—and most importantly—Python is\n",
    "highly readable, so much so that it is fairly easy to guess what this program does even\n",
    "if you have never written a program before.\n",
    "We chose Python because it has a shallow learning curve, its syntax and semantics are\n",
    "transparent, and it has good string-handling functionality. As an interpreted language,\n",
    "Python facilitates interactive exploration. As an object-oriented language, Python per-\n",
    "mits data and methods to be encapsulated and re-used easily. As a dynamic language,\n",
    "Python permits attributes to be added to objects on the fly, and permits variables to be\n",

    "Linguistic fieldwork nltk.toolbox Manipulate data in SIL Toolbox format\n",
    "NLTK was designed with four primary goals in mind:\n",
    "Simplicity\n",
    "To provide an intuitive framework along with substantial building blocks, giving\n",
    "users a practical knowledge of NLP without getting bogged down in the tedious\n",
    "house-keeping usually associated with processing annotated language data\n",
    "Consistency\n",
    "To provide a uniform framework with consistent interfaces and data structures,\n",
    "and easily guessable method names\n",
    "Extensibility\n",
    "To provide a structure into which new software modules can be easily accommo-\n",
    "dated, including alternative implementations and competing approaches to the\n",
    "same task\n",
    "Modularity\n",
    "To provide components that can be used independently without needing to un-\n",
    "derstand the rest of the toolkit\n",
    "Contrasting with these goals are three non-requirements—potentially useful qualities\n",
    "that we have deliberately avoided. First, while the toolkit provides a wide range of\n",
    "functions, it is not encyclopedic; it is a toolkit, not a system, and it will continue to\n",
    "evolve with the field of NLP. Second, while the toolkit is efficient enough to support\n",
    "meaningful tasks, it is not highly optimized for runtime performance; such optimiza-\n",
    "tions often involve more complex algorithms, or implementations in lower-level pro-\n",
    "gramming languages such as C or C++. This would make the software less readable\n",
    "and more difficult to install. Third, we have tried to avoid clever programming tricks,\n",
    "since we believe that clear implementations are preferable to ingenious yet indecipher-\n",
    "able ones.\n",
    "For Instructors\n",
    "Natural Language Processing is often taught within the confines of a single-semester\n",
    "course at the advanced undergraduate level or postgraduate level. Many instructors\n",
    "have found that it is difficult to cover both the theoretical and practical sides of the\n",
    "subject in such a short span of time. Some courses focus on theory to the exclusion of\n",
    "practical exercises, and deprive students of the challenge and excitement of writing\n",
    "programs to automatically process language. Other courses are simply designed to\n",
    "teach programming for linguists, and do not manage to cover any significant NLP con-\n",
    "tent. NLTK was originally developed to address this problem, making it feasible to\n",
    "cover a substantial amount of theory and practice within a single-semester course, even\n",
    "if students have no prior programming experience.\n",
    "Preface | xvA significant fraction of any NLP syllabus deals with algorithms and data structures.\n",
    "On their own these can be rather dry, but NLTK brings them to life with the help of\n",
    "interactive graphical user interfaces that make it possible to view algorithms step-by-\n",
    "step. Most NLTK components include a demonstration that performs an interesting\n",
    "task without requiring any special input from the user. An effective way to deliver the\n",
    "materials is through interactive presentation of the examples in this book, entering\n",
    "them in a Python session, observing what they do, and modifying them to explore some\n",
    "empirical or theoretical issue.\n",
    "This book contains hundreds of exercises that can be used as the basis for student\n",
    "assignments. The simplest exercises involve modifying a supplied program fragment in\n",
    "a specified way in order to answer a concrete question. At the other end of the spectrum,\n",
    "NLTK provides a flexible framework for graduate-level research projects, with standard\n",
    "implementations of all the basic data structures and algorithms, interfaces to dozens\n",
    "of widely used datasets (corpora), and a flexible and extensible architecture. Additional\n",
    "support for teaching using NLTK is available on the NLTK website.\n",
    "We believe this book is unique in providing a comprehensive framework for students\n",
    "to learn about NLP in the context of learning to program. What sets these materials\n",
    "apart is the tight coupling of the chapters and exercises with NLTK, giving students—\n",
    "even those with no prior programming experience—a practical introduction to NLP.\n",
    "After completing these materials, students will be ready to attempt one of the more\n",

    "These expressions have the form [f(w) for ...] or [w.f() for ...] , where f is a\n",
    "function that operates on a word to compute its length, or to convert it to uppercase.\n",
    "For now, you don’t need to understand the difference between the notations f(w) and\n",
    "w.f() . Instead, simply learn this Python idiom which performs the same operation on\n",
    "every element of a list. In the preceding examples, it goes through each word in\n",
    "text1 , assigning each one in turn to the variable w and performing the specified oper-\n",

    "many more examples along with explanations in the following chapters.\n",
    "Nested Code Blocks\n",
    "Most programming languages permit us to execute a block of code when a conditional\n",

    "in code like [w for w in sent7 if len(w) < 4] . In the following program, we have\n",

    "3.3 Text Processing with Unicode | 93What Is Unicode?\n",
    "Unicode supports over a million characters. Each character is assigned a number, called\n",

    "ever, when Unicode characters are stored in files or displayed on a terminal, they must\n",
    "be encoded as a stream of bytes. Some encodings (such as ASCII and Latin-2) use a\n",
    "single byte per code point, so they can support only a small subset of Unicode, enough\n",
    "for a single language. Other encodings (such as UTF-8) use multiple bytes and can\n",
    "represent the full range of Unicode characters.\n",
    "Text in files will be in a particular encoding, so we need some mechanism for translating\n",
    "it into Unicode—translation into Unicode is called decoding. Conversely, to write out\n",
    "Unicode to a file or a terminal, we first need to translate it into a suitable encoding—\n",
    "this translation out of Unicode is called encoding, and is illustrated in Figure 3-3.\n",

    "3.10 Summary\n",
    "• In this book we view a text as a list of words. A “raw text” is a potentially long\n",
    "string containing words and whitespace formatting, and is how we typically store\n",
    "and visualize a text.\n",
    "• A string is specified in Python using single or double quotes: 'Monty Python' ,\n",
    "\"Monty Python\" .\n",
    "• The characters of a string are accessed using indexes, counting from zero: 'Monty\n",
    "Python'[0] gives the value M . The length of a string is found using len() .\n",
    "• Substrings are accessed using slice notation: 'Monty Python'[1:5] gives the value\n",
    "onty . If the start index is omitted, the substring begins at the start of the string; if\n",
    "the end index is omitted, the slice continues to the end of the string.\n",
    "• Strings can be split into lists: 'Monty Python'.split() gives ['Monty', 'Python'] .\n",
    "Lists can be joined into strings: '/'.join(['Monty', 'Python']) gives 'Monty/\n",
    "Python' .\n",
    "• We can read text from a file f using text = open(f).read() . We can read text from\n",
    "a URL u using text = urlopen(u).read() . We can iterate over the lines of a text file\n",
    "using for line in open(f) .\n",
    "• Texts found on the Web may contain unwanted material (such as headers, footers,\n",
    "and markup), that need to be removed before we do any linguistic processing.\n",
    "• Tokenization is the segmentation of a text into basic units—or tokens—such as\n",
    "words and punctuation. Tokenization based on whitespace is inadequate for many\n",
    "applications because it bundles punctuation together with words. NLTK provides\n",
    "an off-the-shelf tokenizer nltk.word_tokenize() .\n",
    "• Lemmatization is a process that maps the various forms of a word (such as ap-\n",
    "peared, appears) to the canonical or citation form of the word, also known as the\n",
    "lexeme or lemma (e.g., appear).\n",
    "• Regular expressions are a powerful and flexible method of specifying patterns.\n",
    "Once we have imported the re module, we can use re.findall() to find all sub-\n",
    "strings in a string that match a pattern.\n",
    "3.10 Summary | 121• If a regular expression string includes a backslash, you should tell Python not to\n",
    "preprocess the string, by using a raw string with an r prefix: r'regexp' .\n",
    "• When backslash is used before certain characters, e.g., \\n , this takes on a special\n",
    "meaning (newline character); however, when backslash is used before regular ex-\n",
    "pression wildcards and operators, e.g., \\. , \\| , \\$ , these characters lose their special\n",

    "However, assignment statements do not always involve making copies in this way.\n",
    "Assignment always copies the value of an expression, but a value is not always what\n",
    "you might expect it to be. In particular, the “value” of a structured object such as a list\n",

    "Each of the preceding lines of code contains a significant feature. A simple string is\n",
    "actually an object with methods defined on it, such as split() . We use a list com-\n",
    "prehension to build a list of tuples , where each tuple consists of a number (the word\n",
    "length) and the word, e.g., (3, 'the') . We use the sort() method to sort the list in\n",
    "place. Finally, we discard the length information and join the words back into a single\n",
    "string . (The underscore is just a regular Python variable, but we can use underscore\n",
    "by convention to indicate that we will not use its value.)\n",
    "We began by talking about the commonalities in these sequence types, but the previous\n",
    "code illustrates important differences in their roles. First, strings appear at the beginning\n",
    "and the end: this is typical in the context where our program is reading in some text\n",
    "and producing output for us to read. Lists and tuples are used in the middle, but for\n",
    "different purposes. A list is typically a sequence of objects all having the same type, of\n",
    "arbitrary length. We often use lists to hold sequences of words. In contrast, a tuple is\n",
    "typically a collection of objects of different types, of fixed length. We often use a tuple\n",
    "to hold a record, a collection of different fields relating to some entity. This distinction\n",
    "between the use of lists and tuples takes some getting used to, so here is another\n",
    "example:\n",
    "136 | Chapter 4: Writing Structured Programs>>> lexicon = [\n",

    "('the', 'det', ['Di:', 'D@']),\n",
    "...\n",
    "('off', 'prep', ['Qf', 'O:f'])\n",
    "... ]\n",
    "Here, a lexicon is represented as a list because it is a collection of objects of a single\n",

    "sampa/). Note that these pronunciations are stored using a list. (Why?)\n",
    "A good way to decide when to use tuples versus lists is to ask whether\n",
    "the interpretation of an item depends on its position. For example, a\n",
    "tagged token combines two strings having different interpretations, and\n",
    "we choose to interpret the first item as the token and the second item\n",
    "as the tag. Thus we use tuples like this: ('grail', 'noun') . A tuple of\n",
    "the form ('noun', 'grail') would be non-sensical since it would be a\n",
    "word noun tagged grail . In contrast, the elements of a text are all tokens,\n",
    "and position is not significant. Thus we use lists like this: ['venetian',\n",
    "'blind'] . A list of the form ['blind', 'venetian'] would be equally\n",
    "valid. The linguistic meaning of the words might be different, but the\n",
    "interpretation of list items as tokens is unchanged.\n",
    "The distinction between lists and tuples has been described in terms of usage. However,\n",
    "there is a more fundamental difference: in Python, lists are mutable, whereas tuples\n",
    "are immutable. In other words, lists can be modified, whereas tuples cannot. Here are\n",
    "some of the operations on lists that do in-place modification of the list:\n",

    "156 | Chapter 4: Writing Structured ProgramsFlippancy aside, debugging code is hard because there are so many ways for it to be\n",
    "faulty. Our understanding of the input data, the algorithm, or even the programming\n",
    "language, may be at fault. Let’s look at examples of each of these.\n",
    "First, the input data may contain some unexpected characters. For example, WordNet\n",
    "synset names have the form tree.n.01 , with three components separated using periods.\n",
    "The NLTK WordNet module initially decomposed these names using split('.') .\n",
    "However, this method broke when someone tried to look up the word PhD, which has\n",
    "the synset name ph.d..n.01 , containing four periods instead of the expected two. The\n",
    "solution was to use rsplit('.', 2) to do at most two splits, using the rightmost in-\n",
    "stances of the period, and leaving the ph.d. string intact. Although several people had\n",
    "tested the module before it was released, it was some weeks before someone detected\n",
    "the problem (see http://code.google.com/p/nltk/issues/detail?id=297).\n",
    "Second, a supplied function might not behave as expected. For example, while testing\n",
    "NLTK’s interface to WordNet, one of the authors noticed that no synsets had any\n",
    "antonyms defined, even though the underlying database provided a large quantity of\n",
    "antonym information. What looked like a bug in the WordNet interface turned out to\n",
    "be a misunderstanding about WordNet itself: antonyms are defined for lemmas, not\n",
    "for synsets. The only “bug” was a misunderstanding of the interface (see http://code\n",
    ".google.com/p/nltk/issues/detail?id=98).\n",
    "Third, our understanding of Python’s semantics may be at fault. It is easy to make the\n",
    "wrong assumption about the relative scope of two operators. For example, \"%s.%s.\n",
    "%02d\" % \"ph.d.\", \"n\", 1 produces a runtime error TypeError: not enough arguments\n",
    "for format string . This is because the percent operator has higher precedence than\n",
    "the comma operator. The fix is to add parentheses in order to force the required scope.\n",
    "As another example, suppose we are defining a function to collect all tokens of a text\n",
    "having a given length. The function has parameters for the text and the word length,\n",
    "and an extra parameter that allows the initial value of the result to be given as a\n",

    "Defensive Programming\n",
    "In order to avoid some of the pain of debugging, it helps to adopt some defensive\n",
    "programming habits. Instead of writing a 20-line program and then testing it, build the\n",
    "program bottom-up out of small pieces that are known to work. Each time you combine\n",
    "these pieces to make a larger unit, test it carefully to see that it works as expected.\n",
    "Consider adding assert statements to your code, specifying properties of a variable,\n",
    "e.g., assert(isinstance(text, list)) . If the value of the text variable later becomes a\n",
    "string when your code is used in some larger context, this will raise an\n",
    "AssertionError and you will get immediate notification of the problem.\n",
    "Once you think you’ve found the bug, view your solution as a hypothesis. Try to predict\n",
    "the effect of your bugfix before re-running the program. If the bug isn’t fixed, don’t fall\n",
    "into the trap of blindly changing the code in the hope that it will magically start working\n",
    "again. Instead, for each change, try to articulate a hypothesis about what is wrong and\n",
    "why the change will fix the problem. Then undo the change if the problem was not\n",
    "resolved.\n",
    "As you develop your program, extend its functionality, and fix any bugs, it helps to\n",
    "maintain a suite of test cases. This is called regression testing, since it is meant to\n",
    "detect situations where the code “regresses”—where a change to the code has an un-\n",
    "intended side effect of breaking something that used to work. Python provides a simple\n",
    "regression-testing framework in the form of the doctest module. This module searches\n",
    "a file of code or documentation for blocks of text that look like an interactive Python\n",
    "session, of the form you have already seen many times in this book. It executes the\n",
    "Python commands it finds, and tests that their output matches the output supplied in\n",
    "the original file. Whenever there is a mismatch, it reports the expected and actual val-\n",
    "ues. For details, please consult the doctest documentation at\n",
    "4.6 Program Development | 159http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html. Apart from its value for regression testing,\n",
    "the doctest module is useful for ensuring that your software documentation stays in\n",
    "sync with your code.\n",
    "Perhaps the most important defensive programming strategy is to set out your code\n",
    "clearly, choose meaningful variable and function names, and simplify the code wher-\n",
    "ever possible by decomposing it into functions and modules with well-documented\n",
    "interfaces.\n",
    "4.7 Algorithm Design\n",
    "This section discusses more advanced concepts, which you may prefer to skip on the\n",
    "first time through this chapter.\n",
    "A major part of algorithmic problem solving is selecting or adapting an appropriate\n",
    "algorithm for the problem at hand. Sometimes there are several alternatives, and choos-\n",
    "ing the best one depends on knowledge about how each alternative performs as the size\n",
    "of the data grows. Whole books are written on this topic, and we only have space to\n",
    "introduce some key concepts and elaborate on the approaches that are most prevalent\n",
    "in natural language processing.\n",
    "The best-known strategy is known as divide-and-conquer. We attack a problem of\n",
    "size n by dividing it into two problems of size n/2, solve these problems, and combine\n",
    "their results into a solution of the original problem. For example, suppose that we had\n",
    "a pile of cards with a single word written on each card. We could sort this pile by\n",
    "splitting it in half and giving it to two other people to sort (they could do the same in\n",
    "turn). Then, when two sorted piles come back, it is an easy task to merge them into a\n",
    "single sorted pile. See Figure 4-3 for an illustration of this process.\n",
    "Another example is the process of looking up a word in a dictionary. We open the book\n",
    "somewhere around the middle and compare our word with the current page. If it’s\n",
    "earlier in the dictionary, we repeat the process on the first half; if it’s later, we use the\n",
    "second half. This search method is called binary search since it splits the problem in\n",
    "half at every step.\n",
    "In another approach to algorithm design, we attack a problem by transforming it into\n",
    "an instance of a problem we already know how to solve. For example, in order to detect\n",
    "duplicate entries in a list, we can pre-sort the list, then scan through it once to check\n",
    "whether any adjacent pairs of elements are identical.\n",
    "Recursion\n",
    "The earlier examples of sorting and searching have a striking property: to solve a prob-\n",
    "lem of size n, we have to break it in half and then work on one or more problems of\n",
    "size n/2. A common way to implement such methods uses recursion. We define a\n",
    "function f, which simplifies the problem, and calls itself to solve one or more easier\n",
    "160 | Chapter 4: Writing Structured ProgramsFigure 4-3. Sorting by divide-and-conquer: To sort an array, we split it in half and sort each half\n",
    "(recursively); we merge each sorted half back into a whole list (again recursively); this algorithm is\n",
    "known as “Merge Sort.”\n",

    "• Python’s assignment and parameter passing use object references; e.g., if a is a list\n",
    "and we assign b = a , then any operation on a will modify b , and vice versa.\n",
    "• The is operation tests whether two objects are identical internal objects, whereas\n",
    "== tests whether two objects are equivalent. This distinction parallels the type-\n",
    "token distinction.\n",
    "• Strings, lists, and tuples are different kinds of sequence object, supporting common\n",
    "operations such as indexing, slicing, len() , sorted() , and membership testing using\n",
    "in .\n",
    "• We can write text to a file by opening the file for writing\n",
    "ofile = open('output.txt', 'w'\n",
    "then adding content to the file ofile.write(\"Monty Python\") , and finally closing\n",
    "the file ofile.close() .\n",
    "• A declarative programming style usually produces more compact, readable code;\n",
    "manually incremented loop variables are usually unnecessary. When a sequence\n",
    "must be enumerated, use enumerate() .\n",
    "• Functions are an essential programming abstraction: key concepts to understand\n",
    "are parameter passing, variable scope, and docstrings.\n",
    "172 | Chapter 4: Writing Structured Programs• A function serves as a namespace: names defined inside a function are not visible\n",
    "outside that function, unless those names are declared to be global.\n",

    "Now that we have examined word classes in detail, we turn to a more basic question:\n",
    "how do we decide what category a word belongs to in the first place? In general, linguists\n",
    "use morphological, syntactic, and semantic clues to determine the category of a word.\n",
    "210 | Chapter 5: Categorizing and Tagging WordsMorphological Clues\n",
    "The internal structure of a word may give useful clues as to the word’s category. For\n",
    "example, -ness is a suffix that combines with an adjective to produce a noun, e.g., happy\n",
    "→ happiness, ill → illness. So if we encounter a word that ends in -ness, this is very likely\n",
    "to be a noun. Similarly, -ment is a suffix that combines with some verbs to produce a\n",
    "noun, e.g., govern → government and establish → establishment.\n",
    "English verbs can also be morphologically complex. For instance, the present par-\n",
    "ticiple of a verb ends in -ing, and expresses the idea of ongoing, incomplete action (e.g.,\n",
    "falling, eating). The -ing suffix also appears on nouns derived from verbs, e.g., the falling\n",
    "of the leaves (this is known as the gerund).\n",
    "Syntactic Clues\n",
    "Another source of information is the typical contexts in which a word can occur. For\n",
    "example, assume that we have already determined the category of nouns. Then we\n",
    "might say that a syntactic criterion for an adjective in English is that it can occur im-\n",
    "mediately before a noun, or immediately following the words be or very. According to\n",
    "these tests, near should be categorized as an adjective:\n",
    "(2)\n",
    "a. the near window\n",
    "b. The end is (very) near.\n",
    "Semantic Clues\n",
    "Finally, the meaning of a word is a useful clue as to its lexical category. For example,\n",
    "the best-known definition of a noun is semantic: “the name of a person, place, or thing.”\n",
    "Within modern linguistics, semantic criteria for word classes are treated with suspicion,\n",
    "mainly because they are hard to formalize. Nevertheless, semantic criteria underpin\n",
    "many of our intuitions about word classes, and enable us to make a good guess about\n",
    "the categorization of words in languages with which we are unfamiliar. For example,\n",
    "if all we know about the Dutch word verjaardag is that it means the same as the English\n",
    "word birthday, then we can guess that verjaardag is a noun in Dutch. However, some\n",
    "care is needed: although we might translate zij is vandaag jarig as it’s her birthday to-\n",

    "Each of these forms—go, goes, gone, and went—is morphologically distinct from the\n",
    "others. Consider the form goes. This occurs in a restricted set of grammatical contexts,\n",
    "and requires a third person singular subject. Thus, the following sentences are\n",
    "ungrammatical.\n",
    "(4)\n",
    "a. *They sometimes goes to the cafe.\n",
    "b. *I sometimes goes to the cafe.\n",

    "that an automatic tagger that uses this tagset is effectively carrying out a limited amount\n",

    "Most part-of-speech tagsets make use of the same basic categories, such as noun, verb,\n",
    "adjective, and preposition. However, tagsets differ both in how finely they divide words\n",

    "5.8 Summary\n",
    "• Words can be grouped into classes, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.\n",
    "These classes are known as lexical categories or parts-of-speech. Parts-of-speech\n",
    "are assigned short labels, or tags, such as NN and VB .\n",
    "• The process of automatically assigning parts-of-speech to words in text is called\n",
    "part-of-speech tagging, POS tagging, or just tagging.\n",
    "• Automatic tagging is an important step in the NLP pipeline, and is useful in a variety\n",
    "of situations, including predicting the behavior of previously unseen words, ana-\n",
    "lyzing word usage in corpora, and text-to-speech systems.\n",
    "• Some linguistic corpora, such as the Brown Corpus, have been POS tagged.\n",
    "• A variety of tagging methods are possible, e.g., default tagger, regular expression\n",
    "tagger, unigram tagger, and n-gram taggers. These can be combined using a tech-\n",
    "nique known as backoff.\n",
    "• Taggers can be trained and evaluated using tagged corpora.\n",
    "• Backoff is a method for combining models: when a more specialized model (such\n",
    "as a bigram tagger) cannot assign a tag in a given context, we back off to a more\n",
    "general model (such as a unigram tagger).\n",
    "• Part-of-speech tagging is an important, early example of a sequence classification\n",
    "task in NLP: a classification decision at any one point in the sequence makes use\n",
    "of words and tags in the local context.\n",
    "• A dictionary is used to map between arbitrary types of information, such as a string\n",
    "and a number: freq['cat'] = 12 . We create dictionaries using the brace notation:\n",
    "pos = {} , pos = {'furiously': 'adv', 'ideas': 'n', 'colorless': 'adj'} .\n",
    "• N-gram taggers can be defined for large values of n, but once n is larger than 3, we\n",
    "usually encounter the sparse data problem; even with a large quantity of training\n",
    "data, we see only a tiny fraction of possible contexts.\n",
    "5.8 Summary | 213• Transformation-based tagging involves learning a series of repair rules of the form\n",

    "6.1 Supervised Classification\n",
    "Classification is the task of choosing the correct class label for a given input. In basic\n",
    "classification tasks, each input is considered in isolation from all other inputs, and the\n",
    "set of labels is defined in advance. Some examples of classification tasks are:\n",
    "221• Deciding whether an email is spam or not.\n",
    "• Deciding what the topic of a news article is, from a fixed list of topic areas such as\n",
    "“sports,” “technology,” and “politics.”\n",

    "sification, the set of labels is not defined in advance; and in sequence classification, a\n",
    "list of inputs are jointly classified.\n",
    "A classifier is called supervised if it is built based on training corpora containing the\n",
    "correct label for each input. The framework used by supervised classification is shown\n",
    "in Figure 6-1.\n",

    "222 | Chapter 6: Learning to Classify TextThe first step in creating a classifier is deciding what features of the input are relevant,\n",
    "and how to encode those features. For this example, we’ll start by just looking at the\n",

    "6.7 Modeling Linguistic Patterns | 2556.8 Summary\n",
    "• Modeling the linguistic data found in corpora can help us to understand linguistic\n",
    "patterns, and can be used to make predictions about new language data.\n",
    "• Supervised classifiers use labeled training corpora to build models that predict the\n",
    "label of an input based on specific features of that input.\n",
    "• Supervised classifiers can perform a wide variety of NLP tasks, including document\n",
    "classification, part-of-speech tagging, sentence segmentation, dialogue act type\n",
    "identification, and determining entailment relations, and many other tasks.\n",
    "• When training a supervised classifier, you should split your corpus into three da-\n",
    "tasets: a training set for building the classifier model, a dev-test set for helping select\n",
    "and tune the model’s features, and a test set for evaluating the final model’s\n",
    "performance.\n",
    "• When evaluating a supervised classifier, it is important that you use fresh data that\n",
    "was not included in the training or dev-test set. Otherwise, your evaluation results\n",
    "may be unrealistically optimistic.\n",
    "• Decision trees are automatically constructed tree-structured flowcharts that are\n",
    "used to assign labels to input values based on their features. Although they’re easy\n",
    "to interpret, they are not very good at handling cases where feature values interact\n",
    "in determining the proper label.\n",
    "• In naive Bayes classifiers, each feature independently contributes to the decision\n",
    "of which label should be used. This allows feature values to interact, but can be\n",
    "problematic when two or more features are highly correlated with one another.\n",
    "• Maximum Entropy classifiers use a basic model that is similar to the model used\n",

    "ture weights that maximizes the probability of the training set.\n",
    "• Most of the models that are automatically constructed from a corpus are descrip-\n",

    "Noun Phrase Chunking\n",
    "We will begin by considering the task of noun phrase chunking, or NP-chunking,\n",
    "where we search for chunks corresponding to individual noun phrases. For example,\n",

    "corresponding NP -chunk, since they almost certainly contain further noun phrases.\n",
    "One of the most useful sources of information for NP -chunking is part-of-speech tags.\n",

    "tribute to other tasks. For example, in Question Answering (QA), we try to improve\n",
    "the precision of Information Retrieval by recovering not whole pages, but just those\n",

    "will say that most such examples are errors, and therefore not part of English after all.\n",
    "Accordingly, we can argue that “modern English” is not equivalent to the very big set\n",
    "of word sequences in our imaginary corpus. Speakers of English can make judgments\n",
    "about these sequences, and will reject some of them as being ungrammatical.\n",
    "Equally, it is easy to compose a new sentence and have speakers agree that it is perfectly\n",
    "good English. For example, sentences have an interesting property that they can be\n",
    "embedded inside larger sentences. Consider the following sentences:\n",

    "• Sentences have internal organization that can be represented using a tree. Notable\n",
    "features of constituent structure are: recursion, heads, complements, and\n",

    "• A grammar is a compact characterization of a potentially infinite set of sentences;\n",
    "we say that a tree is well-formed according to a grammar, or that a grammar licenses\n",
    "a tree.\n",
    "• A grammar is a formal model for describing whether a given phrase can be assigned\n",
    "a particular constituent or dependency structure.\n",
    "• Given a set of syntactic categories, a context-free grammar uses a set of productions\n",
    "to say how a phrase of some category A can be analyzed into a sequence of smaller\n",
    "parts α 1 ... α n .\n",
    "• A dependency grammar uses productions to specify what the dependents are of a\n",

    "• Syntactic ambiguity arises when one sentence has more than one syntactic analysis\n",
    "(e.g., prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity).\n",
    "• A parser is a procedure for finding one or more trees corresponding to a grammat-\n",

    "• A simple top-down parser is the recursive descent parser, which recursively ex-\n",

    "expands categories without checking whether they are compatible with the input\n",

    "results.\n",
    "• A simple bottom-up parser is the shift-reduce parser, which shifts input onto a\n",
    "stack and tries to match the items at the top of the stack with the righthand side\n",
    "of grammar productions. This parser is not guaranteed to find a valid parse for the\n",

    "ibility, we change our treatment of grammatical categories like S , NP , and V . In place of\n",
    "atomic labels, we decompose them into structures like dictionaries, where features can\n",
    "take on a range of values.\n",
    "The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions:\n",

    "9.1 Grammatical Features\n",
    "In Chapter 6, we described how to build classifiers that rely on detecting features of\n",
    "text. Such features may be quite simple, such as extracting the last letter of a word, or\n",
    "more complex, such as a part-of-speech tag that has itself been predicted by the clas-\n",
    "sifier. In this chapter, we will investigate the role of features in building rule-based\n",
    "grammars. In contrast to feature extractors, which record features that have been au-\n",
    "tomatically detected, we are now going to declare the features of words and phrases.\n",
    "We start off with a very simple example, using dictionaries to store features and their\n",
    "values.\n",
    ">>> kim = {'CAT': 'NP', 'ORTH': 'Kim', 'REF': 'k'}\n",
    ">>> chase = {'CAT': 'V', 'ORTH': 'chased', 'REL': 'chase'}\n",
    "327The objects kim and chase both have a couple of shared features, CAT (grammatical\n",
    "category) and ORTH (orthography, i.e., spelling). In addition, each has a more semanti-\n",
    "cally oriented feature: kim['REF'] is intended to give the referent of kim , while\n",
    "chase['REL'] gives the relation expressed by chase . In the context of rule-based gram-\n",
    "mars, such pairings of features and values are known as feature structures, and we\n",
    "will shortly see alternative notations for them.\n",
    "Feature structures contain various kinds of information about grammatical entities.\n",
    "The information need not be exhaustive, and we might want to add further properties.\n",
    "For example, in the case of a verb, it is often useful to know what “semantic role” is\n",
    "played by the arguments of the verb. In the case of chase, the subject plays the role of\n",
    "“agent,” whereas the object has the role of “patient.” Let’s add this information, using\n",
    "'sbj' (subject) and 'obj' (object) as placeholders which will get filled once the verb\n",
    "combines with its grammatical arguments:\n",
    ">>> chase['AGT'] = 'sbj'\n",
    ">>> chase['PAT'] = 'obj'\n",
    "If we now process a sentence Kim chased Lee, we want to “bind” the verb’s agent role\n",
    "to the subject and the patient role to the object. We do this by linking to the REF feature\n",
    "of the relevant NP . In the following example, we make the simple-minded assumption\n",
    "that the NP s immediately to the left and right of the verb are the subject and object,\n",
    "respectively. We also add a feature structure for Lee to complete the example.\n",

    "• The traditional categories of context-free grammar are atomic symbols. An impor-\n",
    "tant motivation for feature structures is to capture fine-grained distinctions that\n",

    "• By using variables over feature values, we can express constraints in grammar pro-\n",
    "ductions that allow the realization of different feature specifications to be inter-\n",

    "• Typically we specify fixed values of features at the lexical level and constrain the\n",
    "values of features in phrases to unify with the corresponding values in their\n",
    "children.\n",
    "• Feature values are either atomic or complex. A particular subcase of atomic value\n",
    "is the Boolean value, represented by convention as [+/- feat ].\n",
    "• Two features can share a value (either atomic or complex). Structures with shared\n",
    "values are said to be re-entrant. Shared values are represented by numerical indexes\n",
    "(or tags) in AVMs.\n",
    "• A path in a feature structure is a tuple of features corresponding to the labels on a\n",
    "sequence of arcs from the root of the graph representation.\n",
    "• Two paths are equivalent if they share a value.\n",
    "• Feature structures are partially ordered by subsumption. FS 0 subsumes FS 1 when\n",

    "• The unification of two structures FS 0 and FS 1 , if successful, is the feature structure\n",

    "Coming more from the perspective of computational linguistics, (Kay, 1985) proposed\n",

    "we will also see that to address the problem in a more general way, we have to open up\n",
    "a whole new box of ideas and techniques, involving the representation of meaning.\n",

    "11.1 Corpus Structure: A Case Study\n",
    "The TIMIT Corpus was the first annotated speech database to be widely distributed,\n",
    "and it has an especially clear organization. TIMIT was developed by a consortium in-\n",

    "to provide data for the acquisition of acoustic-phonetic knowledge and to support the\n",
    "development and evaluation of automatic speech recognition systems.\n",
    "The Structure of TIMIT\n",
    "Like the Brown Corpus, which displays a balanced selection of text genres and sources,\n",
    "TIMIT includes a balanced selection of dialects, speakers, and materials. For each of\n",
    "eight dialect regions, 50 male and female speakers having a range of ages and educa-\n",
    "tional backgrounds each read 10 carefully chosen sentences. Two sentences, read by\n",
    "all speakers, were designed to bring out dialect variation:\n",
    "407(1)\n",
    "a. she had your dark suit in greasy wash water all year\n",
    "b. don’t ask me to carry an oily rag like that\n",
    "The remaining sentences were chosen to be phonetically rich, involving all phones\n",
    "(sounds) and a comprehensive range of diphones (phone bigrams). Additionally, the\n",
    "design strikes a balance between multiple speakers saying the same sentence in order\n",
    "to permit comparison across speakers, and having a large range of sentences covered\n",
    "by the corpus to get maximal coverage of diphones. Five of the sentences read by each\n",
    "speaker are also read by six other speakers (for comparability). The remaining three\n",
    "sentences read by each speaker were unique to that speaker (for coverage).\n",
    "NLTK includes a sample from the TIMIT Corpus. You can access its documentation\n",
    "in the usual way, using help(nltk.corpus.timit) . Print nltk.corpus.timit.fileids()\n",

    "Notable Design Features\n",
    "TIMIT illustrates several key features of corpus design. First, the corpus contains two\n",
    "layers of annotation, at the phonetic and orthographic levels. In general, a text or speech\n",
    "corpus may be annotated at many different linguistic levels, including morphological,\n",
    "syntactic, and discourse levels. Moreover, even at a given level there may be different\n",
    "labeling schemes or even disagreement among annotators, such that we want to rep-\n",
    "resent multiple versions. A second property of TIMIT is its balance across multiple\n",
    "dimensions of variation, for coverage of dialect regions and diphones. The inclusion of\n",
    "speaker demographics brings in many more independent variables that may help to\n",
    "account for variation in the data, and which facilitate later uses of the corpus for pur-\n",
    "poses that were not envisaged when the corpus was created, such as sociolinguistics.\n",
    "A third property is that there is a sharp division between the original linguistic event\n",
    "captured as an audio recording and the annotations of that event. The same holds true\n",
    "of text corpora, in the sense that the original text usually has an external source, and\n",
    "is considered to be an immutable artifact. Any transformations of that artifact which\n",
    "involve human judgment—even something as simple as tokenization—are subject to\n",
    "later revision; thus it is important to retain the source material in a form that is as close\n",
    "to the original as possible.\n",
    "A fourth feature of TIMIT is the hierarchical structure of the corpus. With 4 files per\n",
    "sentence, and 10 sentences for each of 500 speakers, there are 20,000 files. These are\n",
    "organized into a tree structure, shown schematically in Figure 11-2. At the top level\n",
    "11.1 Corpus Structure: A Case Study | 409Figure 11-2. Structure of the published TIMIT Corpus: The CD-ROM contains doc, train, and test\n",
    "directories at the top level; the train and test directories both have eight sub-directories, one per dialect\n",
    "region; each of these contains further subdirectories, one per speaker; the contents of the directory for\n",
    "female speaker aks0 are listed, showing 10 wav files accompanied by a text transcription, a word-\n",
    "aligned transcription, and a phonetic transcription.\n",
    "there is a split between training and testing sets, which gives away its intended use for\n",
    "developing and evaluating statistical models.\n",
    "Finally, notice that even though TIMIT is a speech corpus, its transcriptions and asso-\n",
    "ciated data are just text, and can be processed using programs just like any other text\n",
    "corpus. Therefore, many of the computational methods described in this book are ap-\n",
    "plicable. Moreover, notice that all of the data types included in the TIMIT Corpus fall\n",
    "into the two basic categories of lexicon and text, which we will discuss later. Even the\n",
    "speaker demographics data is just another instance of the lexicon data type.\n",
    "This last observation is less surprising when we consider that text and record structures\n",
    "are the primary domains for the two subfields of computer science that focus on data\n",
    "management, namely text retrieval and databases. A notable feature of linguistic data\n",
    "management is that it usually brings both data types together, and that it can draw on\n",
    "results and techniques from both fields.\n",
    "410 | Chapter 11: Managing Linguistic DataFundamental Data Types\n",
    "Despite its complexity, the TIMIT Corpus contains only two fundamental data types,\n",
    "namely lexicons and texts. As we saw in Chapter 2, most lexical resources can be rep-\n",
    "resented using a record structure, i.e., a key plus one or more fields, as shown in\n",
    "Figure 11-3. A lexical resource could be a conventional dictionary or comparative\n",
    "wordlist, as illustrated. It could also be a phrasal lexicon, where the key field is a phrase\n",
    "rather than a single word. A thesaurus also consists of record-structured data, where\n",
    "we look up entries via non-key fields that correspond to topics. We can also construct\n",
    "special tabulations (known as paradigms) to illustrate contrasts and systematic varia-\n",
    "tion, as shown in Figure 11-3 for three verbs. TIMIT’s speaker table is also a kind of\n",
    "lexicon.\n",
    "Figure 11-3. Basic linguistic data types—lexicons and texts: Amid their diversity, lexicons have a\n",
    "record structure, whereas annotated texts have a temporal organization.\n",
    "At the most abstract level, a text is a representation of a real or fictional speech event,\n",
    "and the time-course of that event carries over into the text itself. A text could be a small\n",
    "unit, such as a word or sentence, or a complete narrative or dialogue. It may come with\n",
    "annotations such as part-of-speech tags, morphological analysis, discourse structure,\n",
    "and so forth. As we saw in the IOB tagging technique (Chapter 7), it is possible to\n",
    "represent higher-level constituents using tags on individual words. Thus the abstraction\n",
    "of text shown in Figure 11-3 is sufficient.\n",
    "11.1 Corpus Structure: A Case Study | 411Despite the complexities and idiosyncrasies of individual corpora, at base they are col-\n",
    "lections of texts together with record-structured data. The contents of a corpus are\n",
    "often biased toward one or the other of these types. For example, the Brown Corpus\n",
    "contains 500 text files, but we still use a table to relate the files to 15 different genres.\n",
    "At the other end of the spectrum, WordNet contains 117,659 synset records, yet it\n",
    "incorporates many example sentences (mini-texts) to illustrate word usages. TIMIT is\n",
    "an interesting midpoint on this spectrum, containing substantial free-standing material\n",
    "of both the text and lexicon types.\n",
    "11.2 The Life Cycle of a Corpus\n",
    "Corpora are not born fully formed, but involve careful preparation and input from\n",
    "many people over an extended period. Raw data needs to be collected, cleaned up,\n",
    "documented, and stored in a systematic structure. Various layers of annotation might\n",
    "be applied, some requiring specialized knowledge of the morphology or syntax of the\n",
    "language. Success at this stage depends on creating an efficient workflow involving\n",
    "appropriate tools and format converters. Quality control procedures can be put in place\n",
    "to find inconsistencies in the annotations, and to ensure the highest possible level of\n",
    "inter-annotator agreement. Because of the scale and complexity of the task, large cor-\n",
    "pora may take years to prepare, and involve tens or hundreds of person-years of effort.\n",
    "In this section, we briefly review the various stages in the life cycle of a corpus.\n",
    "Three Corpus Creation Scenarios\n",
    "In one type of corpus, the design unfolds over in the course of the creator’s explorations.\n",
    "This is the pattern typical of traditional “field linguistics,” in which material from elic-\n",
    "itation sessions is analyzed as it is gathered, with tomorrow’s elicitation often based on\n",
    "questions that arise in analyzing today’s. The resulting corpus is then used during sub-\n",
    "sequent years of research, and may serve as an archival resource indefinitely. Comput-\n",
    "erization is an obvious boon to work of this type, as exemplified by the popular program\n",
    "Shoebox, now over two decades old and re-released as Toolbox (see Section 2.4). Other\n",
    "software tools, even simple word processors and spreadsheets, are routinely used to\n",
    "acquire the data. In the next section, we will look at how to extract data from these\n",
    "sources.\n",
    "Another corpus creation scenario is typical of experimental research where a body of\n",
    "carefully designed material is collected from a range of human subjects, then analyzed\n",
    "to evaluate a hypothesis or develop a technology. It has become common for such\n",
    "databases to be shared and reused within a laboratory or company, and often to be\n",
    "published more widely. Corpora of this type are the basis of the “common task” method\n",
    "of research management, which over the past two decades has become the norm in\n",
    "government-funded research programs in language technology. We have already en-\n",
    "countered many such corpora in the earlier chapters; we will see how to write Python\n",
    "412 | Chapter 11: Managing Linguistic Dataprograms to implement the kinds of curation tasks that are necessary before such cor-\n",
    "pora are published.\n",
    "Finally, there are efforts to gather a “reference corpus” for a particular language, such\n",
    "as the American National Corpus (ANC) and the British National Corpus (BNC). Here\n",
    "the goal has been to produce a comprehensive record of the many forms, styles, and\n",
    "uses of a language. Apart from the sheer challenge of scale, there is a heavy reliance on\n",
    "automatic annotation tools together with post-editing to fix any errors. However, we\n",
    "can write programs to locate and repair the errors, and also to analyze the corpus for\n",
    "balance.\n",
    "Quality Control\n",
    "Good tools for automatic and manual preparation of data are essential. However, the\n",
    "creation of a high-quality corpus depends just as much on such mundane things as\n",
    "documentation, training, and workflow. Annotation guidelines define the task and\n",
    "document the markup conventions. They may be regularly updated to cover difficult\n",
    "cases, along with new rules that are devised to achieve more consistent annotations.\n",
    "Annotators need to be trained in the procedures, including methods for resolving cases\n",
    "not covered in the guidelines. A workflow needs to be established, possibly with sup-\n",
    "porting software, to keep track of which files have been initialized, annotated, validated,\n",
    "manually checked, and so on. There may be multiple layers of annotation, provided by\n",
    "different specialists. Cases of uncertainty or disagreement may require adjudication.\n",
    "Large annotation tasks require multiple annotators, which raises the problem of\n",
    "achieving consistency. How consistently can a group of annotators perform? We can\n",
    "easily measure consistency by having a portion of the source material independently\n",
    "annotated by two people. This may reveal shortcomings in the guidelines or differing\n",
    "abilities with the annotation task. In cases where quality is paramount, the entire corpus\n",
    "can be annotated twice, and any inconsistencies adjudicated by an expert.\n",
    "It is considered best practice to report the inter-annotator agreement that was achieved\n",
    "for a corpus (e.g., by double-annotating 10% of the corpus). This score serves as a\n",
    "helpful upper bound on the expected performance of any automatic system that is\n",

    "Deciding Which Layers of Annotation to Include\n",
    "Published corpora vary greatly in the richness of the information they contain. At a\n",
    "minimum, a corpus will typically contain at least a sequence of sound or orthographic\n",
    "symbols. At the other end of the spectrum, a corpus could contain a large amount of\n",
    "information about the syntactic structure, morphology, prosody, and semantic content\n",
    "of every sentence, plus annotation of discourse relations or dialogue acts. These extra\n",
    "layers of annotation may be just what someone needs for performing a particular data\n",
    "analysis task. For example, it may be much easier to find a given linguistic pattern if\n",
    "we can search for specific syntactic structures; and it may be easier to categorize a\n",
    "linguistic pattern if every word has been tagged with its sense. Here are some commonly\n",
    "provided annotation layers:\n",
    "Word tokenization\n",
    "The orthographic form of text does not unambiguously identify its tokens. A to-\n",
    "kenized and normalized version, in addition to the conventional orthographic ver-\n",
    "sion, may be a very convenient resource.\n",
    "Sentence segmentation\n",
    "As we saw in Chapter 3, sentence segmentation can be more difficult than it seems.\n",
    "Some corpora therefore use explicit annotations to mark sentence segmentation.\n",

    "Shallow semantics\n",
    "Named entity and coreference annotations, and semantic role labels.\n",
    "Dialogue and discourse\n",
    "Dialogue act tags and rhetorical structure.\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is not much consistency between existing corpora in how they\n",
    "represent their annotations. However, two general classes of annotation representation\n",
    "should be distinguished. Inline annotation modifies the original document by insert-\n",
    "ing special symbols or control sequences that carry the annotated information. For\n",
    "example, when part-of-speech tagging a document, the string \"fly\" might be replaced\n",
    "with the string \"fly/NN\" , to indicate that the word fly is a noun in this context. In\n",
    "contrast, standoff annotation does not modify the original document, but instead\n",
    "creates a new file that adds annotation information using pointers that reference the\n",
    "original document. For example, this new document might contain the string \"<token\n",
    "id=8 pos='NN'/>\" , to indicate that token 8 is a noun.\n",
    "Standards and Tools\n",
    "For a corpus to be widely useful, it needs to be available in a widely supported format.\n",
    "However, the cutting edge of NLP research depends on new kinds of annotations,\n",
    "which by definition are not widely supported. In general, adequate tools for creation,\n",
    "publication, and use of linguistic data are not widely available. Most projects must\n",
    "develop their own set of tools for internal use, which is no help to others who lack the\n",
    "necessary resources. Furthermore, we do not have adequate, generally accepted stand-\n",
    "ards for expressing the structure and content of corpora. Without such standards, gen-\n",
    "eral-purpose tools are impossible—though at the same time, without available tools,\n",
    "adequate standards are unlikely to be developed, used, and accepted.\n",
    "One response to this situation has been to forge ahead with developing a generic format\n",
    "that is sufficiently expressive to capture a wide variety of annotation types (see Sec-\n",
    "tion 11.8 for examples). The challenge for NLP is to write programs that cope with the\n",
    "generality of such formats. For example, if the programming task involves tree data,\n",
    "and the file format permits arbitrary directed graphs, then input data must be validated\n",
    "to check for tree properties such as rootedness, connectedness, and acyclicity. If the\n",
    "input files contain other layers of annotation, the program would need to know how\n",
    "to ignore them when the data was loaded, but not invalidate or obliterate those layers\n",
    "when the tree data was saved back to the file.\n",
    "11.3 Acquiring Data | 421Another response has been to write one-off scripts to manipulate corpus formats; such\n",
    "scripts litter the filespaces of many NLP researchers. NLTK’s corpus readers are a more\n",
    "systematic approach, founded on the premise that the work of parsing a corpus format\n",
    "should be done only once (per programming language).\n",
    "Instead of focusing on a common format, we believe it is more promising to develop a\n",

    "Note that this approach follows accepted practice within computer science, viz. ab-\n",

    "tags must have corresponding closing tags, at the same level of nesting (i.e., the XML\n",
    "document must be a well-formed tree).\n",
    "XML permits us to repeat elements, e.g., to add another gloss field, as we see next. We\n",

    "This illustrates some of the flexibility of XML. If it seems somewhat arbitrary, that’s\n",

    "them as deeply as we like. We can repeat elements, leave them out, and put them in a\n",

    "no past_tense element is permitted. To impose some order over all this freedom, we\n",

    "akin to a context-free grammar. Tools exist for testing the validity of an XML file with\n",
    "respect to a schema.\n",
    "The Role of XML\n",
    "We can use XML to represent many kinds of linguistic information. However, the\n",
    "flexibility comes at a price. Each time we introduce a complication, such as by permit-\n",

    "accesses the data. We also make it more difficult to check the validity of the data, or to\n",
    "interrogate the data using one of the XML query languages.\n",
    "Thus, using XML to represent linguistic structures does not magically solve the data\n",
    "modeling problem. We still have to work out how to structure the data, then define\n",
    "that structure with a schema, and then write programs to read and write the format\n",
    "and convert it to other formats. Similarly, we still need to follow some standard prin-\n",
    "ciples concerning data normalization. It is wise to avoid making duplicate copies of the\n",
    "same information, so that we don’t end up with inconsistent data when only one copy\n",
    "is changed. For example, a cross-reference that was represented as <xref>headword</\n",
    "xref> would duplicate the storage of the headword of some other lexical entry, and the\n",
    "link would break if the copy of the string at the other location was modified. Existential\n",
    "dependencies between information types need to be modeled, so that we can’t create\n",
    "elements without a home. For example, if sense definitions cannot exist independently\n",
    "426 | Chapter 11: Managing Linguistic Dataof a lexical entry, the sense element can be nested inside the entry element. Many-to-\n",
    "many relations need to be abstracted out of hierarchical structures. For example, if a\n",
    "word can have many corresponding senses, and a sense can have several corresponding\n",
    "words, then both words and senses must be enumerated separately, as must the list of\n",

    "8. ◑ Write a function that takes a lexicon and finds which pairs of consecutive fields\n",

    "Language Processing Versus Symbol Processing\n",
    "The very notion that natural language could be treated in a computational manner grew\n",
    "out of a research program, dating back to the early 1900s, to reconstruct mathematical\n",
    "reasoning using logic, most clearly manifested in work by Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein,\n",
    "Tarski, Lambek, and Carnap. This work led to the notion of language as a formal system\n",
    "amenable to automatic processing. Three later developments laid the foundation for\n",
    "natural language processing. The first was formal language theory. This defined a\n",
    "language as a set of strings accepted by a class of automata, such as context-free lan-\n",
    "guages and pushdown automata, and provided the underpinnings for computational\n",
    "syntax.\n",
    "The second development was symbolic logic. This provided a formal method for cap-\n",
    "turing selected aspects of natural language that are relevant for expressing logical\n",
    "proofs. A formal calculus in symbolic logic provides the syntax of a language, together\n",
    "with rules of inference and, possibly, rules of interpretation in a set-theoretic model;\n",
    "examples are propositional logic and first-order logic. Given such a calculus, with a\n",
    "well-defined syntax and semantics, it becomes possible to associate meanings with\n",
    "expressions of natural language by translating them into expressions of the formal cal-\n",
    "culus. For example, if we translate John saw Mary into a formula saw(j, m), we (im-\n",

    "the technical machinery to perform inferences that are an important part of language\n",
    "understanding.\n",
    "A closely related development was the principle of compositionality, namely that\n",
    "the meaning of a complex expression is composed from the meaning of its parts and\n",
    "their mode of combination (Chapter 10). This principle provided a useful corre-\n",
    "spondence between syntax and semantics, namely that the meaning of a complex ex-\n",
    "pression could be computed recursively. Consider the sentence It is not true that p,\n",
    "where p is a proposition. We can represent the meaning of this sentence as not(p).\n",
    "442 | Afterword: The Language ChallengeSimilarly, we can represent the meaning of John saw Mary as saw(j, m). Now we can\n",
    "compute the interpretation of It is not true that John saw Mary recursively, using the\n",
    "foregoing information, to get not(saw(j,m)).\n",
    "The approaches just outlined share the premise that computing with natural language\n",
    "crucially relies on rules for manipulating symbolic representations. For a certain period\n",
    "in the development of NLP, particularly during the 1980s, this premise provided a\n",

    "Contemporary Philosophical Divides\n",
    "The contrasting approaches to NLP described in the preceding section relate back to\n",
    "early metaphysical debates about rationalism versus empiricism and realism versus\n",
    "idealism that occurred in the Enlightenment period of Western philosophy. These\n",
    "debates took place against a backdrop of orthodox thinking in which the source of all\n",
    "knowledge was believed to be divine revelation. During this period of the 17th and 18th\n",
    "centuries, philosophers argued that human reason or sensory experience has priority\n",
    "over revelation. Descartes and Leibniz, among others, took the rationalist position,\n",
    "asserting that all truth has its origins in human thought, and in the existence of “innate\n",
    "ideas” implanted in our minds from birth. For example, they argued that the principles\n",
    "of Euclidean geometry were developed using human reason, and were not the result of\n",
    "supernatural revelation or sensory experience. In contrast, Locke and others took the\n",
    "empiricist view, that our primary source of knowledge is the experience of our faculties,\n",
    "and that human reason plays a secondary role in reflecting on that experience. Often-\n",
    "cited evidence for this position was Galileo’s discovery—based on careful observation\n",
    "of the motion of the planets—that the solar system is heliocentric and not geocentric.\n",
    "In the context of linguistics, this debate leads to the following question: to what extent\n",
    "does human linguistic experience, versus our innate “language faculty,” provide the\n",
    "Afterword: The Language Challenge | 443basis for our knowledge of language? In NLP this issue surfaces in debates about the\n",
    "priority of corpus data versus linguistic introspection in the construction of computa-\n",
    "tional models.\n",
    "A further concern, enshrined in the debate between realism and idealism, was the\n",
    "metaphysical status of the constructs of a theory. Kant argued for a distinction between\n",
    "phenomena, the manifestations we can experience, and “things in themselves” which\n",
    "can never been known directly. A linguistic realist would take a theoretical construct\n",
    "like noun phrase to be a real-world entity that exists independently of human percep-\n",
    "tion and reason, and which actually causes the observed linguistic phenomena. A lin-\n",
    "guistic idealist, on the other hand, would argue that noun phrases, along with more\n",
    "abstract constructs, like semantic representations, are intrinsically unobservable, and\n",
    "simply play the role of useful fictions. The way linguists write about theories often\n",
    "betrays a realist position, whereas NLP practitioners occupy neutral territory or else\n",
    "lean toward the idealist position. Thus, in NLP, it is often enough if a theoretical ab-\n",
    "straction leads to a useful result; it does not matter whether this result sheds any light\n",
    "on human linguistic processing.\n",
    "These issues are still alive today, and show up in the distinctions between symbolic\n",
    "versus statistical methods, deep versus shallow processing, binary versus gradient clas-\n",
    "sifications, and scientific versus engineering goals. However, such contrasts are now\n",
    "highly nuanced, and the debate is no longer as polarized as it once was. In fact, most\n",
    "of the discussions—and most of the advances, even—involve a “balancing act.” For\n",
    "example, one intermediate position is to assume that humans are innately endowed\n",
    "with analogical and memory-based learning methods (weak rationalism), and use these\n",
